This plugin performs a coloration of a set of polygons, ensuring that two contiguous polygons does not have the same color.

It take a vector layer of polygons as input, and write them to a new file with a new attribute for the color index.

The algorithm does not guarantee a minimum number of colors, but try to minimize it.
